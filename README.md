# Kaamelott-random-quote-generator

This little project is part of the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) front-end development curriculum.
It consists in a Jquery app that retrieves random quotes from [this node/expres API](https://github.com/SebNoret/simple-node-api-for-random-quote) inspired by [another one](https://kaamelott.chaudie.re/) (Github repo of the API [here](https://github.com/sin0light/api-kaamelott/)).

The selected quotes can be shared on Twitter with a button.
