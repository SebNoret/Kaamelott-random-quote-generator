# Kaamelott-random-quote-generator

This little project is part of the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) front-end development curriculum.
It consists in a Jquery app that retrieves random quotes from [this api](https://kaamelott.chaudie.re/).
The selected quotes can be shared on Twitter with a button

Github repo of the API [here](https://github.com/sin0light/api-kaamelott/).

## TODO
the api does not accept cross origin http request. To develop this app I add to use a CORS proxy server. 
I think i will reuse the idea of the api and create my own in node JS .
